# Object-Detection-YOLOv4
An Object Detection App using YOLO and openCV

Here, we use openCV lirary to get images of the objects using the devices camera, then we use YOLOv4 trained model to detect and

classify the objects in that image.

YOLOv4 is the fourth version in the "You Only Look Once" family of models. YOLOv4 makes realtime detection a priority and conducts training on a single GPU.

YOLOv4 model is used for object detection. It can classify upto 80 types of objects.
